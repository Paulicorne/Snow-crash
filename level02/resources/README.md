## LEVEL02

- We have a .pcap file
- Go check it on a pcap reader website
- Check for pushed packets from user to server
- Check every character sent, including DEL char (only the last char of each 1 byte packet is important)
- After deleting the chars we don't need, we get the level02 password for the flag !
